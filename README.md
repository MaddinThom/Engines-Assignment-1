# Engines-Assignment-1

This is the level editor assignment for Game Engine Design and Implementation. The levels in my group's GDW game is not set in stone and therefore, we
don't know yet how exactly they will look. For this assignment, I decided to create a basic level that could resemble the obstacles player interact with
in the GDW game. The player-controlled object can jump, move and uses the environment objects to make it to the end of the level, the door.
